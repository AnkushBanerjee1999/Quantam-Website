    Farouk launched Quantam in the UAE in 2007 to provide future-sensing, result-driven consultancy and technology services across all markets and all sectors. Today Quantam is 65+ strong.

    name: 'Zlatko Delic',
    title: 'Partner & Director - Strategic Alliances',
    bio: `Zlatko is a 'natural' strategic thinker deploying his consultancy skills across an array of sectors including Logistics & Aviation, to Oil & Gas, as well as Information Technology & Digital Transformation.

    He joined the Quantam team in 2014. Time and again, Zlatko's engaging, precise communication style demonstrates to clients how Ikon by Quantam delivers accurate, real-time information across all sectors.

    He is regularly appreciated for his canny ability to identify and explain easy-to-convert, new revenue streams, as well as cost efficiencies. Zlatko's practise of 'looking beneath the surface' could lie in the fact that he holds an BA in Architecture.

    He says the thought-process is the same for buildings or IT frameworks, mooting success lies in not boxing design in a box. Indeed, Zlatko can integrate his left and right brain, ensuring facts and precision align perfectly with future sensing and creative thinking. Committed to delivering constant results to clients, he keeps an eye on the opportunities of tomorrow, with a sharp focus on the power of now.`,
